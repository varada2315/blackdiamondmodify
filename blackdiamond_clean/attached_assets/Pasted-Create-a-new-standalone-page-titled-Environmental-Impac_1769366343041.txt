Create a new standalone page titled “Environmental Impact Calculator” for BlackDiamondGranites.
The purpose of this page is to let visitors interactively calculate the real environmental impact of granite recycling, based on realistic industry assumptions and the actual plant process.
Page Objective:
Help users understand how much environmental damage is avoided when granite waste is recycled.
Translate industrial recycling into clear, measurable impact metrics.
Maintain technical credibility suitable for investors, regulators, and the public.
Calculator Inputs (Keep Simple):
Granite Waste Processed (in Tons) – numeric input
Example placeholder: Enter quantity in tons (e.g., 100, 500, 1000)
Calculation Logic (Use Industry-Realistic Estimates):
River Sand Saved
Assume ~0.75 tons of river sand replaced per ton of recycled granite.
Granite Waste Diverted from Dumping
1 ton processed = 1 ton waste diverted.
Fresh Water Saved
Assume ~1.5 KL water used per ton, with ~90% recycled via closed-loop system.
Environmental Impact Indicators (Non-Carbon Claims)
Reduced river sand mining
Reduced slurry dumping and groundwater contamination
Reduced dependency on virgin aggregates
Results Section (Stats View):
Display results as clear stat cards or counters, for example:
River Sand Saved: ___ tons
Waste Diverted from Landfill: ___ tons
Fresh Water Saved: ___ KL
Environmental Benefit: Reduced river mining and water stress
Include simple icons or visual indicators, but keep the design industrial and factual, not playful.
Disclaimers (Important):
Add a small note below results:
Figures are indicative estimates based on industry averages and plant recovery efficiencies. Actual results may vary depending on material characteristics and operating conditions.
Tone & Constraints:
Avoid terms like 100% green, carbon neutral, or zero waste.
Focus on measured, defensible impact.
Match the existing site’s dark, industrial, premium aesthetic.
Do not oversell sustainability; explain environmental protection through engineering.
The final page should make visitors clearly understand:
“Because this granite is recycled here, this much environmental damage is avoided.”
