Build a premium investor-focused website for a Granite Waste Recycling Plant.

The website must communicate industrial scale, environmental responsibility, and regulatory readiness.
This is an investor & compliance-grade website, not a casual marketing site.

DESIGN SYSTEM

Primary color: Deep Black (#0b0b0b)

Secondary color: Stone / Granite Silver (#9e9e9e, #b3b3b3)

Accent colors: Muted mineral green, steel blue, concrete beige (only where appropriate)

Overall feel: Industrial, minimal, premium

Typography:

Clean modern font (Inter / SF / Montserrat style)

Strong headings, restrained body text

SECTION 1: HERO (NO PROCESS GRAPHICS HERE)
Hero Headline

Zero-Waste Granite Recycling

Hero Subheadline

Transforming granite waste into high-quality construction materials through a closed-loop, environmentally responsible recycling process.

Supporting Line (small text)

Sustainable • Compliant • Scalable • Future-Ready

Hero Visual

Dark industrial background

Subtle motion (gradient shift / abstract industrial animation)

No diagrams or process visuals in hero

SECTION 2: PROCESS FLOW (MOTION GRAPHICS SECTION — VERY IMPORTANT)
Section Title

Closed-Loop Recycling Process

Section Intro (short)

Our plant operates on a fully integrated, zero-waste recycling model where granite waste is systematically processed, reused, and converted into certified construction materials with no liquid discharge.

Core Requirement

I am attaching an image of the Process Flow Diagram.

Recreate this exact process as motion graphics

Animate the flow step-by-step

Arrows must animate to show continuous circular movement

Use SVG / CSS / JS animations

Smooth, premium transitions (fade + slide or line-draw)

Process Steps (use these exact labels)

Granite Waste Intake

Pre-Sorting

Primary Crushing (Jaw Crusher)

Screening

Secondary / Tertiary Crushing

Sand Washing

Vibrating Screening

Filter Press & Slurry Handling

Water Recycling (Closed Loop)

Saleable Products & Stockpiling

Caption Rule

Each step should show only one technical line on hover or scroll:

“Size reduction for controlled material grading”

“Washing removes impurities and recovers fines”

“Clarified water reused in washing cycle”

SECTION 3: SUSTAINABILITY & COMPLIANCE
Section Title

Built for Environmental Compliance

Content

The plant is engineered to meet and exceed environmental norms through advanced pollution control systems, efficient water management, and zero-waste processing.

Key Highlights

SECTION 5: INVESTOR & PARTNER VALUE
Section Title

Designed for Long-Term Value

Content

This facility represents a future-ready industrial model aligned with circular economy principles, regulatory frameworks, and sustainable infrastructure growth.

Value Points

Reduced dependency on natural sand and quarrying

Strong regulatory positioning and approval readiness

Scalable operations on large land parcel

Consistent demand from regional infrastructure development

Environmentally responsible revenue generation

FOOTER

Clean, minimal

Focus on credibility and professionalism

No aggressive CTAs

ANIMATION & TECH GUIDELINES

Motion graphics must start after the hero section

Use scroll-triggered animations

No flashy or playful effects

Smooth, restrained, premium motion

Desktop-first, fully responsive

IMPORTANT NOTE

This website must feel:

Industrial

Trust-driven

Investor-ready

Compliance-oriented

Do not redesign the process logic.
Animate and present it clearly.
